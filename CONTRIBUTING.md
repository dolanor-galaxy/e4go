# Contributing

Although E4 is an in-house-developed product by Teserakt.io, it is still open-source, GPLv2-licensed software. This means you can hack it any way you want and contribute things back if you'd like to. As a software company, we focus on implementing features that are important to our products but would gladly spend some time on making E4 useful for everybody.
